# DelaunayDivideAndConquer

Implementation of a Divide and Conquer strategy to build a Delaunay triangulation. The implemented method comes from Rex A. Dwyer ([1]), which is an improved version of the method described in [2] by Guibas and Stolfi.

# MST

An implementation of Kruskal's MST algorithm is also given in this repository. These two algorithms was initially used together to find the MST of a fully connected graph (Delaunay triangulation used to reduce number of edges before using Kruskal on reduced graph)
